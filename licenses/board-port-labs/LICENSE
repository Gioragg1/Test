The trees found within this directory are git trees for the Linux
kernel and u-boot.  These trees are based on the AM335x part and
are meant to serve as a reference for general tasks involved in a board
port.  These trees go along with the training available at:

http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Sitara_Linux_Training

Inside of each directory is a full git repository.  These repositories
have tags that make isolating the changes for each functionality easier.
You can view the tag using the "git tag" command and use "gitk --all"
to better view the git tree contents.

The individual trees are licensed under the same license as the Linux
kernel and u-boot sources which is the GPLv2 license. A copy of license
for the kernel and u-boot can be found in a file called COPYING within
each of the respective git repositories.
